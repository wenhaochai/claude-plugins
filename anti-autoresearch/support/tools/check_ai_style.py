check_ai_style.py — deterministic arm of the AI writing-style impression track (AIS).

The AIS track is the repo's ONLY non-integrity output: transparent, itemized impressions of
AI-generated *writing style*. They are emitted under skill "ai-style-impressions" and the
adjudicator gives every AIS finding ZERO verdict weight (forced to info, excluded from the
verdict) — a paper can be `CLEAN_GIVEN_EVIDENCE` and still list many. We surface them because
reviewers demonstrably react to them, but they are NOT integrity findings and imply NO
authorship probability. We are not an opaque AI-text classifier.

Most AIS signals are semantic (the `ai-style-impressions` skill's reviewer pass). This tool
ships the ONE that is objectively computable: the defensive-hedge density screen
(`AIS-DEFENSIVE-HEDGE`). It fires only on a genuine pattern — never on one scoping sentence —
and flags the recurrence of the hedge SHAPE, never who wrote it.
